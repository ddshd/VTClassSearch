# VTClassSearch
#### A website to enable faster search into Virginia Tech's class timetable.

This site uses PHP and POST requests into Virginia Tech's live timetable and displays the results in an iFrame. The default Virginia Tech timetable requires the user to select the class department through a dropdown list and then enter the class number.

This website allows the user to just enter the full class information (Dept. ID + Class No.) and it will send the appropriate POST request to Virginia Tech's server. This is a much easier and faster process then VT's own website.
